	<li><bp>How negative emotion improves conflict-driven adaptive control</bp></li>
         <p>
  Negative emotion enhances cognitive control, and more specifically conflict adaptation. In this project, we assessed the actual time-scale of facilitatory effect of integral negative emotion, defined by monetary loss-related feedback contingent on task performance, on conflict adaptation. Further, we utilized electroencephalography (EEG) technique to address at which stage during stimulus processing this facilitatory effect takes place, and what his electrophysiological manifestation may be.

<li><bp>The beneficial effect of reappraisal on cognitive control: making the experience of conflict less aversive reduces conflict adaptation</bp></li>

	  <p>
	  Conflict adaptation is a standard behavioral index of cognitive control. Negative emotion enhances it, and correspondingly, the regulation of negative emotion could in principle decrease it. In this study, we test whether reappraisal, known as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, could lower conflict adaptation or not.

	  <li><bp>The involvement of reactive vs. proactive control in the congruency sequence effect</bp></li>

	  <p>
    The congruency sequence effect (CSE) refers to facilitated conflict processing following incongruent compared to congruent trials. This phenomenon has long been interpreted as reflecting the involvement of reactive control action upon conflict detection and involved in forthcoming conflict resolution. However, in some situations, the use of proactive control can also trigger trial by trial adjustments in cognitive control levels (CSE). In this project, we adopted two different ways (change the proportion of incongruency within a block vs. provide (in)formative cues) inducing reactive and proactive control to investigate their contributions, separately.
